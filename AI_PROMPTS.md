# AI Usage Documentation

## Prompts Used
1. "Generate Playwright test for SauceDemo login"
2. "Create add-to-cart test with assertions for name, price"
3. "Suggest stable selector strategy for flaky UI"
4. "Design Docker setup for Playwright automation"

## How AI Accelerated Work
- Generated baseline Playwright syntax
- Helped identify business-critical flows
- Suggested Docker image and setup
- Reduced setup time significantly

## AI Suggestions Rejected
- Using text selectors instead of data-test attributes
- Overusing waits/timeouts instead of Playwright auto-wait
- Writing overly broad E2E flows without assertions

## Validation of Correctness
- Manually inspected SauceDemo DOM
- Verified selectors against live HTML
- Executed tests locally and via Docker
- Reviewed failures via video and trace
